across an XSS in a bug bounty program, this was quite fun to exploit.\n\nA little bit of context, the URL was as follows:\n\nGoing thru the page code we can clearly see a reflection in a javascript tag, around the entry \"subject\".\n\nLet's try with my favorite test payload AAAA\"&lt;i&gt;'BBBB(1) and see how the characters are escaped.\n\nThe tag was stripped but the double quote isn't escaped. We can say goodbye to the infamous &lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1) payload. Let's try to bypass the filter with a little bit of Javascript magic :D\nIn JS if we have a string we can try to add a function and it will be executed, a simple alert(1) should do the work. Our payload is now AAAA\"+alert(1)+\"BBBB\n\nDamn, it seems that our parenthesis were removed, let's try with an alternative way to trigger an alert using the backticks : AAAA\"+alert\\1`+\"BBBB`, this trick works on Firefox and Chrome/Opera in their latest version.\n\nYay our alert(1) popped :D, let's now imagine more protections, only to do some JS magic.\nWe can try to eval() our alert() using the backticks and some escape characters.\nWhat if eval and alert are banned keywords ?\nWe can still use the New Function !\n\nIn Javascript we can escape any character and they will be treated as the original character if it doesn't exist.\n\nThat's all folks !\n","id":"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/an-xss-story/","title":"An XSS Story"},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/auto-obfuscate-strings-with-nim/":{"body":"TLDR: Use nim-strenc, or read below to discover how to write your own Nim macro.\n![NimMacro]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/OffensiveNim/nimlang.png)\nLately I discovered the repository Yardanico/nim-strenc, you can use it very easily in your Nim code by importing strenc.\nLet's try it on this simple example. First you need to install the package using this command: nimble install strenc\n\nYou can compile the code with nim c -d=danger --passl=-flto --threads:on --opt=size --out=demo demo.nim and the compiler will display some hints.\n\nIn the hints we see the string \"demo string\" is automagically replaced by m611v5u8zi(estring(\"\\x16\\x10\\x19\\x18V\\n\\f\\t\\x13\\x13\\e\"), 1823285395), reducing our static analysis detections.\nBefore going deeper in the code of nim-strenc, we need to understand a bit of macro term-rewriting.\n\nTerm rewriting macros are macros or templates that have not only a name but also a pattern that is searched for after the semantic checking phase of the compiler: This means they provide an easy way to enhance the compilation pipeline with user defined optimizations:\n\nTerm rewriting macro are applied recursively. This means that if the result of a term rewriting macro is eligible for another rewriting, the compiler will try to perform it, and so on, until no more optimizations are applicable.\nNow let's try some basic macros. For example the following macro can be used to generate a debug statement if the variable debug is set to true\n\nThis is nice but we can go deeper by interacting directly with variables and their types. If you are unsure about how a type is represented and handled in Nim, you can use dumpTree to generate the Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) at compile time. This will be very useful to debug our macros.\n\nThe output will look like this:\nStmtList\nConstSection\nConstDef\nIdent \"cfgversion\"\nIdent \"string\"\nStrLit \"1.0\"\nConstSection\nConstDef\nIdent \"cfglicenseOwner\"\nEmpty\nStrLit \"John Doe\"\nWe now have everything to understand the code of nim-strenc. The code starts by defining a new type estring (#L7) otherwise our macro will be called recursively on our newly created string.\n\nThen it defines a proc to encrypt an estring using a key, note that the key is an integer. The name of this proc will be the same in every generated binary\n\nThe encryption is doing a basic XOR where the key is modified a bit after every character. in order to avoid having always the same key in the produced binary, nim-strenc uses a simple but effective trick, by generating a hash based on the compile time and date.\n\nFinally there is the macro to match every String Literal from the source code, encrypt it with the proc m611v5u8zi then it will rewrite the matched string to m611v5u8zi(estring(\"\\xFF...\\xXX\"), counter). Since the encryption is a XOR it can effectively use the same proc to encode and decode the string.\nIt uses getAst to generate the correct AST for our replaced string, and then the counter is modified.\n\nThere are some limitations to this library\n\nthe name of the encrypting/decrypting proc is always the same: m611v5u8zi, and it is a HUGE red flag..\nweak encryption using XOR operation, it might be interesting to implement a stronger algorithm, but the key is \"random\" for each build.\nit is just obfuscation and patterns for decryption are easily discoverable by any reverser :D\n\nReferences\n\nYardanico/nim-strenc - A tiny library to automatically encrypt string literals in Nim code\nCompile-time string obfuscation - Nim Forum\nRewrite all string literals? - Nim Forum\nNim Documentation\nNim Documentation: term-rewriting-macros\nDemystification of Macros in Nim\nMacros in Nim - Tutorial\n\n","id":"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/auto-obfuscate-strings-with-nim/","title":"Offensive Nim - Auto Obfuscate Strings with Nim's Term-Rewriting Macros"},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/drink-love-share-rump/":{"body":"Recently I had the pleasure to give a rump during the \"Drink Love Share\" meet organized by TheLaluka. This blog post will delve deeper into the topic.\n\nThis rump told the tale of a little Dino starting in the red team industries.\nBuild The Infrastructure\n\nOur Dino started his assessment like everybody by provisioning several servers, at least one C2, Redirector, Phishing.\nHe also bought a domain \"dinosrv.com and requested some HTTPS certificate for its infrastructure because he likes to have 🔒 on his phishing pages.\n\nBut he already did some mistakes and requested certificates for the whole infrastructure using Let's Encrypt. And by doing so, he leaked the C2 server \"dinostrike.dinosrv.com\", the phishing infrastructure \"meteorcorp.gophish.dinosrv.com\" and more importantly he also used the client name in the subdomain \"microsoft.dinosrv.com\".\nMany companies will have proactive phishing detections in place which can query the Certificate Transparency for specific keywords linked to them. You can try it yourself by clicking the \"OPEN THE FIRE HOSE\" button on certstream.calidog.io.\nAs a general guideline, it is highly recommended to avoid any links or references to the targeted company. You can also limit the certificate exposure by requesting a \"wildcard\" certificate: *.dinosrv.com.\nPhishing Attempt\n\nHowever our little dino didn't care about those mistakes and continued its phishing deployment. He installed and configured a basic Gophish instance.\nAnd that is his second critical mistake.\n\nBy default Gophish comes with pre-configured indicators of compromise (IOC):\n\nEvery email sent will contain a phishing with a rid parameter to identify the target: campaign.go#L130\nThe default server name used in the transparency response is gophish: config.go#L46 e.g: msg.SetHeader(\"X-Mailer\", config.ServerName)\nFinally you also send the X-Gophish-Contact header indicating your email and that you are using Gophish: email_request.go#L123\n\nAs a general guideline you should always check the source code for potential detection sinks and backdoors. It is not always a good idea to use the easiest click and deploy method, take some time to review and test your infrastructure.\nAlso, the IOC mentionned in this blogpost can appear in several in the Gophish source code, don't forget to find and delete them all 😉.\nIOC Party\n\nOur little dino sent the phishing emails with his fresh infrastructure and started to get some shells back.\nFor the story sake, we won't focus on how the beacons were generated and why customers clicked on the binary. Let's say they are very willing to be compromised.\n\nYay a lot of shell sessions came back to our C2 infrastructure, little dino is quite happy, but something smells fishy. Why is there so many different machines, who is Johnny Cage and why the process is malwar.exe ? Also why does the beacon die after 10 seconds and a new one appear ?\n\nAfter investigating, our little dino came to the conclusion: someone is sharing the binary and he is starting to get shells outside of the targeted organization.\nIn fact, many mistakes and misconfigurations were done. For starter, the host staging feature was enabled in his Command and Control server. This allows the beacon to request the second part of the payload from the server, while it seems to be a nice feature to send a small binary without too much detections, this is also a way for investigators to get the second part of the shellcode. More details on how to extract the full shellcode here: Cobalt Strike Staging and Extracting Configuration Information - @FranticTyping\nIn a nutshell, you can generate a valid checksum8 URI to get the shellcode using this Python code.\n\nCommon Mistakes\nHere are some common errors that can ruin your op:\n\nUploading your payload on VirusTotal or letting the antivirus send the samples from your Virtual Machines\nAllowing anyone to contact your infrastructure, at least put some geographical limitation. In a better scenario, you should allow only your Team and Customer IPs.\nUse a redirector, don't expose your C2 TLS stack to the web. JA3, JA3S and JARM are different fingerprint methods targeting the SSL/TLS layer.\nDon't use the default configuration of the beacon, either simulate an attacker with a specific configuration or create your own: threatexpress/malleable-c2/jquery-c2.4.9.profile\n\n\nGoing back to our story, our little dino executed the command whoami.exe to know the username of the compromised user. However this is worst way to know this information as this is an easily signatured behavior elastic/detection-rules/discovery_whoami_command_activity\nHere are some pointers to do it without spawning whoami,\n\nList your kerberos tickets\nLook for the owner of the process that spawned your beacon\nList your environment variables: dir env: and dir env:USERNAME\nUse a beacon object file (BOF) to bring your own whoami: trustedsec/CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF/whoami\n\nThere are other way, just be creative 🦖\nDinosaurs Thinks In Graphs\n\nNow that we got our initial access, our little dino is going to enumerate the network and the Active Directory.\n\nHe used the famous BloodHound collector BloodHoundAD/SharpHound, but he should have run it from the memory using the command execute-assembly instead of dropping the binary on the disk.\nLightweight Dinosaurs Access Protocol\nAlso the output of the collector can be detected (output.json, domain.json, etc).\n\nBloodHound indicated that we can use the Kerberoasting attack against several accounts.\n\nAny valid domain user can request a kerberos ticket (ST) for any domain service. Once the ticket is received, password cracking can be done offline on the ticket to attempt to break the password for whatever user the service is running as. - InternalAllTheThings\n\n\nArmed from the best tools in his arsenal, little dino is running the Kerberoasting module. But this will generate a lot of noises because it doesn't target a single account by default.\nThe LDAP query is using a wildcard to find the service principal name\n: \"(&amp;(servicePrincipalName=*)(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=512)(!(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2))(!(objectCategory=computer)))\" - ldap.py. It might pick up honeypot Service Account.\nYou should also keep in mind the encryption method used for the ticket.\n\nKerberos RC4 - Default (Ticket Encryption Type = 0x17)\nAES (Ticket Encryption Type = 0x12)\n\n\nIOC Party 2\nFinally, our dino managed to crack some hashes and retrieve their password. It is now time to move onto another machines and services.\n\nImpacket is a great suite of scripts, but you have to know their behavior before executing them, otherwise you will get caught like our little dino.\nHere is some common pitfalls:\n\nsmbexec.py is using a service to execute commands. In the earliest version, it was named BTOBTO but it has now 8 random characters.\npsexec.py is still based on a well known service released on January 2012. 10+ years later, we have a lot of detection based on that kavika13/RemComSvc\nwmiexec.py is not better, every command will be prefixed with cmd.exe /Q /c. Ref: wmiexec.py#L127\n\nAs a general guideline it is always better to blend in and use the same tools used by infra/dev/internal team, which could be anything: RDP, WinRM/PS Remoting, etc.\n\nAfter some long pivoting sessions, it was time for the best dino in town to dump the holy grail: the ntds database.\nHowever, here are some tips to know when doing a DCSync:\n\nThe replication is always done between 2 Domain Controllers which are Machine Accounts. Don't do it with a user account, remember that you can still create 10 machine accounts if needed. 🍿\nYou don't need to dump the whole database, the account krbtgt will grant you every access you need.\n\nPivoting To The Clouds\n\nAfter compromising the entire internal network, our dino couldn't leave without poking at the cloud. He discovered some credentials in the desktop of an employee.\n\nIn theory, he only had to use the credential with the aws cli to connect to the Amazon Web Service API.\nBut you shouldn't do it from a Kali,Parrot or Pentoo machine, because the Boto3 library used by the AWS binary is generating a user-agent based on the platform: 6.5.0-kali3-amd64 in our example. GuardDuty IAM finding types\n\nAnd it's Game Over for our dino, he got caught by the Blue Dinos. Next time he will be more stealthy and move like a ninja 🥷\nReferences\n\nDrinkLoveShare V1 - Rump Session - TheLaluka - 19 janv. 2024\nDrinkLoveShare V1 - Slides DLS24-red-team-fails-dino.pdf\nNever had a bad day phishing.

I found this small opensource IoT hacking learning board while I was in a security event. It is designed by @vulcainreo and cost around 45€, more than 300 units were shipped around the world.\nLet's dig into this awesome project and clone the git : https://github.com/Vulcainreo/DVID.git !\n\n\nHardware - findTheDatasheet\n\nA password is displayed on the pin PD1\n\nFirst we need to push the correct firmware to start playing with the device, the LED will blink.\n\nWe are asked to connect RX to the PD1 pin to get the password, we need to check the Datasheet to know where is the PD1 pin.\n![RXfind]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DVID/rx_finddatasheet.jpg \"RXfind\"){: .center-image }\nThe board is using an ATmega328, let's check the pinout from Wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATmega328, we see PD1 is linked to UART TXD pin.\n\nUsing the Gerber file Gerber_BottomLayer.GBL provided in the github we can also see the PD1 pin is linked to Soft Flash TX, I used http://www.gerber-viewer.com to display the file.\n![GerberViewer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DVID/GerberViewerPD1bis.png \"GerberViewer\"){: .center-image }\nA simple wiring to the UART port is enough to connect the DVID to my Kali Linux VM, we can then access i\nt through /dev/ttyUSB0. We can check our VM logs using dmesg command.\n\nFrom there we only need to read the output with Python or with minicom -b 9600 -o -D /dev/ttyUSB0 (use Ctrl A + X to exit).\n\n![Minicom]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DVID/minicom_finddatasheet.png \"Minicom\"){: .center-image }\nFirmware - Default Password\n\nA confidential message is stored on the firmware but protected by a default password.\n\nOnce again we push the firmware : sudo avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p -U flash:w:defaultPassword.ino.arduino_standard.hex.\nSince the challenge is to find a default password, we will connect to the debug interface (UART) of the DVID and try to interact with it. First we need to wire it correctly, remember to pair RX with TX and TX with RX, and do NOT plug the USB if you wire the 5v pin ;)\n\nUsing the code from the last challenge we can write a simple script to interact with the device /dev/ttyUSB0. We will iterate over the john wordlist to bruteforce the service until it responds with \"ok\" instead of \"ko\".\n\nAnd we got it ! Obviously the password is hidden, real one is available here :D\n![DefaultPasswd]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DVID/defaultpasswd.jpg \"DefaultPasswd\"){: .center-image }\nFirmware - Hardcoded Password\n\nA confidential message is stored on the firmware but protected by a password.\n\nWe push the firmware with  sudo avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p -U flash:w:hardcodedPassword.ino.arduino_standard.hex.\nNow we will dump the previously sent firmware, we could just analyse the hardcodedPassword.ino.arduino_standard.hex file but it is not realistic.\n\nNow we have a file dump.hex containing the current firmware, let's convert it to binary with avr-objcopy -I ihex -O elf32-avr dump.hex dump.elf.\nwe could also dump the firmware as raw binary with sudo avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p -F -U flash:r:dump.raw:r.\nFrom these dumps we can make a wordlist of every strings in there, then we will try to bruteforce the service by sending everyone of them.\n\nWe can reuse the last challenge script, this time we have to remove the s.readline() line since we are blindly attacking the service. Nothing will be outputted on the serial port in case of a good password, we need to pay attention to the screen, fortunately the password is in our small list of 15 passwords.\n\nThe time.sleep(10) is very important, we don't want to flood the board with too many passwords !\n![HardPasswd]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DVID/hardpasswd.jpg \"HardPasswd\"){: .center-image }\nBluetooth - Advertising\n\nA confidential message is stored on the firmware but protected by a password\n\n\nThe goal is to provide a screenshot of the confidential message\nTips: Hey ! Advertise me to know my name\n\nI had to setup my virtual machine correctly to use the Bluetooth dongle provided with the DVID, the following commands were enough to get it running. However I later discovered the BLE was not working as it should be...\n\nNOTE: from there I switched to my Phone and the application NRF Connect.

First we need to extract the columns number of the current \"SELECT column1, column2 FROM ...\"\n\nWe can clearly see the injection point is located in the 4th columns.\nLet's extract the version now\n\nExtract database name\n\nThis is interesting, there is an ECW database. Let's dig into it by extracting the table name.\n\nExtract columns name\n\nThat's great now we can do a simple \"SELECT\" query to get the username and password of every users.\n\nUnfortunately there are a lot of flags, we can try them all.. or be a little bit smarter.\nSince we can dump the content we can try to export the \"comment\" section\n\nThis one looked promising, and we can validate with it.\nWeb 100 - Pass Through\nAt first, I was looking for an SQL injection in order to bypass the login, the following payload worked:\n\nIt says the \"password is the flag\", damn we need to extract it with a blind injection. After a lot of tries I discovered it was an XPATH injection instead of an SQL. We will use the string-length to check the size of a string, here we know the size of the username, this will help verify our guess.\n\nNow we can script this in order to extract the size of the password, since we know it's &gt;20 and &lt;40.\n\nThe output of this script will give the the length of the password : 37\nNow we will extract the characters one by one with the \"substring\" method, e.g:substring(\"ABCD\",2,1)='B'\n\nWith this we get BCPP6f5f5724aa2fa973bb9471746c2cb4a0} which looks like a flag, we can easily correct the first chars : ECW{6f5f5724aa2fa973bb9471746c2cb4a0}\nWeb 150 - GoldFish\nGoldFish was a Web Application written in PHP, where you can write a \"post-it\" which will self-destroy after 30sec.\nFor this challenge I created a user named \"glopglopglop\" this will be needed for the exploitation ;)\nFirst I tried to exploit an XSS, you could write a \"Post\" with the following input:\n\nThe \"Post\" would be available at \"/posts/user/postname\" (this URL was found when you submit the same post twice in less than 30sec)\nHere is a simple output that triggered the XSS (the payload is from XSSHunter), it was available at https://challenge-ecw.fr/chals/web150/posts/glopglopglop/mymemo\n\nI waited hours and hours, nothing happened..\nThen I try to fuzz a little bit the \"name\" field since we could \"rewrite\" the URL. I finally managed to find an LFI with the source code reflected in the dashboard inside the memo. Thanks to this we could extract all the source code of the WebApp\n\nThe cookie part was interesting, it is decrypting its content with \"decryptString\". By looking deeper in the generation of the cookie I discovered it was based on the name of the user but the password wasn't part of it.\n\nThis encrypted string was used in the cookie as follow:\n\nThis means we can forge our cookie to be connected as admin since we only need a valid hash based on his name.\n\nThe \"ID\" of admin was '1', after replacing our cookie with the forged one we get the following flag:\n\nWeb 175 - Magic Car\nThe topic of this challenge was the following text: \"Notre nouveau système de réservation de covoiturage a été piraté.

We had to find a way to login without a valid username/password. The source code of the challenge was also provided.\n\nSo we need to have an MD5 hash equal to 0e413229387827631581229643338212. This is a basic type juggling in PHP, because 0e0123.. is a float representation in PHP we can do the following:\n\nWe want a magic hashed in PHP, it's an hash where the content is only made of integers.

In this scenario you can :\n\nsend an email to the team if he was logged into his mail account\n\n\n\nif he was using Linux, you may want to keep a simple backdoor in order to do a privilege escalation and become a root user, the easiest way to achieve is to backdoor the .bashrc with a reverse-shell\n\n\nWritten password\nMaybe the most unskilled scenario, sometimes the user will write some interesting informations onto a paper sheet or a post-it, and leave it on their desktop. You can just grab the credential.\n![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/security-password-postit.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\nOutdated components\nThe computer has to be updated, if your colleague doesn't do the regular patches you might be able to take advantages of this. Commonly you can target the Operating system e.g:Windows XP with MS08-067, or the Browser (Chrome/Firefox etc)\nGuest account\nSometimes the guest account is enable and allows you to get further access into the machine.\nLightDM (Ubuntu 16.04/16.10) - Guest Account Local Privilege Escalation\nDebug components\nMost of the times you can acces the debug application on the port 80 on the internal network if there is no filtering. Depending of the application you look for :\n\nCommon vulnerabilites (OWASP top 10)\nDebug interface (Python Flask)\n\nUSB Live ISO\nWhen there is no bios password, it's easy to compromise the computer by booting with a Live USB / Live CD and adding the backdoor.\nGrub - Root access\nEven if there is a bios password you still need to secure your Grub (boot-manager), otherwise anyone can edit it in order to start a root shell.\n\nUSB : Rubber Ducky or Teensy\nIf you are willing to spend around 40$, you can buy a Rubber Ducky. This is a fake USB which will act as a keyboard and send any key to the plugged computer. The payload can be created within a notepad or online at https://ducktoolkit.com/.\nThe full documentation is available at https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript\nThe following script was generated by DuckToolkit and serve a directory via HTTP\n\nAlternatively you can buy a Teensy board for 15$, it requires a little bit of configuration but it works as well\nFirst, you need to install the arduino IDE, the Teensyduino and the rules for the Teensy board.\n\nThe following code press the keys [ALT]+[F2], then write \"xterm\", followed by an echo into the user's .bashrc\n\nNOTE: When programming the board press the \"RESET\" button to avoid the launch of the payload on your computer\nInitramfs Backdoor - Encrypted Hard Drive\nWhen you're booting there is one partition that is not encrypted in order to start. It will ask for your password and then decrypt and mount the other partition. If you have and access to the hard drive it is possible to replace the Initramfs.img in order to get the password to decrypt the full hdd, you can also wait for the decryption and then inject what you want inside a file as root :)\nMounting boot partition (not encrypted)\n\nExtracting initramfs-linux\n\nAdding the backdoor and packaging back to a .img\n\n","id":"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/frenchcroissant/","title":"French Croissant - or why you need to lock your computer"},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/hip19-meetyourdoctor/":{"body":"Last wednesday I was in the Hack In Paris event for the 3rd time. As always there were some great conferences and challenges, and a new competition called \"Hacker Jeopardy\" which was very fun! During the Wargame I focused my time on Web challenges based on the graphql technology which was new to me, you will find below my writeups for the Meet Your Doctor challenges.\n![HIP Wargame 2019]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HIP19/hip19_wargame.png \"HIP Wargame 2019\"){: .center-image }\n\nMeet your doctor 1 - 100 pts\nURL: http://meetyourdoctor1.challs.malice.fr\nGoal : Please help me find the Meet your doctor Admin password\nGobuster revealed a /graphql endpoint at the root of the website, browsing http://meetyourdoctor1.challs.malice.fr/graphql gave us an access to an interactive GraphQL interpreter. On this page we can browse the documentation and schema.\nThere, we can get the structure of the Doctor type.\n\nIt seems we don't need to authenticate with the mutation signIn to query Doctor data.\n\nA simple query {Doctors{id email password}} was enough to extract all doctors' email and password. The flag was the password of the Admin doctor : Now-_Let$|GetSeri0us\n![GraphQL UI]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HIP19/doctors1graphql.png \"GraphQL UI\")\nMeet your doctor 2 - 200 pts\nURL: http://meetyourdoctor2.challs.malice.fr\nGoal: I need to find the Patient 0 social security number! It is a matter of life and death\nIn this challenge we didn't have access to an online \"lab\" to test and query the GraphQL. I made a tool to interact with the /graphql endpoint, it is open-source and available for free on Github: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/GraphQLmap.\nUsing Introspection we can still get the GraphQL schema, here is the URL-encoded version (Full version available at \"GraphQL Injection: enumerate-database-schema-via-introspection\").\n\nIt is strongly recommended to use Firefox to view the server response as it parses JSON an displays it nicely.\n![Doctors schema]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HIP19/doctors2_schema.png \"Doctors schema\")\nUsing GraphQLmap, we got the following structure.\n\nIn this case Doctors have an options parameter which accepts JSON. It allows us to specify items linked to the doctors' structure and project their data into the GraphQL response. I saw the following picture in a blog post, it helped me a lot to understand the structure of the query.\n![GraphMap]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HIP19/graphmap.png \"GraphMap\")\nWe can query {doctors(options: \"{\\\"patients.ssn\\\" :1}\"){firstName lastName id patients{ssn}}}, don't forget to escape the \" inside the options.\n\nThere we go, the second flag was b16cff8b-4a5a-41c8-8545-d9880fd7aae5.\nAn asciinema version is available at https://asciinema.org/a/sbqGXnWXl5Y6YeQr0wzsCzQli\nMeet your doctor 3 - 300 pts\nURL: http://meetyourdoctor3.challs.malice.fr\nGoal: I need to find the Patient 0 social security number! It is a matter of life and death\nThings are getting complicated, we can't dump the schema as the Introspection is set to false. Based on the previous challenge we can guess the structure is the same. Unfortunately we can't reuse the same query to extract the ssn, we get the following error.\n\nThis means there is a search argument in the doctor structure, something like doctors[Doctor]: options (JSON!), search(JSON!).\nPete Correy explains how to exploit the search argument in his blog post GraphQL NoSQL Injection Through JSON Types.\nLet's try a simple NoSQL injection with fields we know such as lastName.\n\nSince the challenge I added a way to test the regex quickly in GraphQLmap using the GRAPHQL_CHARSET keyword inside a GraphQL query:\n\nThe injection worked, now we can re-use the payload from the challenge #2 and extract the social security number of the patient 0, which is the patient of the Admin doctor. The query was as follows, where we had to replace CHARACTER_FROM_THE_FLAG to test characters from the flag.\n\nObviously we scripted the data extraction in Python, the script below will get the last flag : 4f537c0a-7da6-4acc-81e1-8c33c02ef3b.\n![NOSQL]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HIP19/doctors3_nosql.png \"NOSQL\")\nAt that time we were checking if the content of r.json()['data']['doctors'] was not empty, in order to abstract the data extraction we now take a check input from the user in order to compare the output.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the challenges as I did !\nFeel free to share the blog post ! :)\n","id":"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/hip19-meetyourdoctor/","title":"HIP19 Writeup - Meet Your Doctor 1,2,3"},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/payload-plz/":{"body":"Last weekend, I took part in the LeHack 2025 event in Paris. As always, the challenges hosted by YesWeHack were top-notch and full of valuable learning opportunities. This year's highlight was crafting a polyglot payload capable of triggering in 13 different contexts, including SQL injection, XSS, Bash command execution, and more.\n\nThere was 2 ways to win YesWeHack swags:\n\nComplete all 13 challenges\nSolve at least 6 challenges using the same payload\n\nHuge thanks to the organizers and the platform creator! The interface was intuitive and visually appealing, with excellent syntax highlighting. I especially appreciated the \"wrap code\" option and the ability to adjust the font size in the code view — perfect for folks like me who are... well, let's just say the eyes aren’t what they used to be. 👴\n\nSolving 13 challenges\nLet's delve into how I solved every challenge, one by one, and identify some quick wins and interesting behavior for the second part of the contest.\nXSS 1\nContext: The goal is to call alert(flag)\n\nPayload: Any HTML tag than can trigger a JS execution (img onerror, svg onload, script).\n\nXSS 2\nContext: Same context as XSS1, but the input is executed inside a script tag.\n\nPayload: Escape from the '' context and use a JavaScript comment to get rid of the quote.\n\nSQL Injection 1\nContext: The application uses SQLite3 to execute SQL queries, and the input is normalized using NFKC normalization. We are also given the structure of the database\n\n\nPayload: Extract the flag from the flag table.\n⚠️ Each table argument of 'UNION' must have the same number of columns you can use NULL keyword to create empty column. - Reference: SQLite UNION\n\nSQL Injection 2\nContext: Same database structure and normalization as in SQL 1, but the injection occurs in a number comparison.\n\nPayload: Same payload as before, without the quote to close the string.\n\nXPath Injection\nContext: Extract the password of the admin user. The structure of the XML was also given.\n\n\nPayload: I hate XPATH it gives me headaches, here is the payload from ChatGPT.\n\n\n  \n  SPOILER ALERT: this shortcut cost me a lot.\n\nJinja SSTI\nContext: The flag is stored in the environment variable FLAG. There is no escaping applied to the user input, so you can inject Jinja2 expressions directly.\n\n\nPayload: The check to validate the flag was a bit off, I discovered you could display every environment variables and it would be considered as a SUCCESS since the flag content was inside. The final payload was executing the env binary, thanks to Podalirius' research it is a very small payload: Python vulnerabilities : Code execution in jinja templates - July 27, 2021.\n\nBrainfuck\nContext: The flag is split into two parts, the first part is stored in memory starting at address 0. The second part is available on stdin. The brainfuck.js implementation was also given.\n\nPayload: Thank you o4-mini for your thinking.\n\nERB SSTI\nContext: Ruby ERB Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability. There is no escaping applied to the user input. The flag is stored in the environment variable FLAG.\n\nPayload:\n\nTwig SSTI\nContext: Twig Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability. Same context as the other SSTI.\n\nPayload: Calling the env binary, because RCE &gt; SSTI ♥️\n\nSmarty SSTI\nContext: Same context as the other SSTI.\n\nPayload: At first I fetched the content of the /proc/self/environ file, then I went back to the good old env binary.\n\nBash\nContext: Command execution where you read the flag from the environment variable FLAG.\n\nPayload:\n\n  \n\n\nXXE\nContext: Use the XXE vulnerability to read the flag from a file. The flag is stored in /dev/shm/flag.txt.\n\n\nPayload: Basic XXE payload solves the challenge.\n\nPath Traversal\nContext: Classical Path Traversal vulnerability in PHP.\n\n\nPayload: Use ../ to go back to the root folder and then fetch the file containing the environment variables.\n\nPolyglot\n\nCraft a single payload that solves multiple challenges at once. The more challenges you solve, and the shorter your payload, the better your score.\n\nThe score was calculated using this formula: score = (number of challenges solved × 1000) − payload length\nA polyglot payload is a specially crafted input that is valid in multiple different contexts or interpreters, allowing it to bypass security filters or be executed in more than one way depending on how and where it is used.\nXSS 1 and XSS 2\nLet's start with the easy task of merging the 2 XSS payloads, we can put them one after the other: '&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(flag)&gt;\nSQL 1 and SQL 2\nThings starts to get tricky for the SQL injections because of the quote from the payload of SQLi #1.\n\nWe can use a SQLite comment \"--\" to remove it when it is un-necessary: 9 union select flag,flag,0 from flag--' union select flag,null,null from flag\n\nBut I discovered later that I needed the quote to escape the Bash context, fortunately the description of the challenge is giving us a big hint about NFKC normalization. In short, unicode characters will be transformed into equivalent character.\nCharacterUnicodeNameNormalizes to\nʼU+02BCMODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE' (U+0027)\nʹU+02B9MODIFIER LETTER PRIME' (U+0027)\n＇U+FF07FULLWIDTH APOSTROPHE' (U+0027) OK\n\nThe payload is looking the same but the quote has been substituted to \"＇\".\n\nBrainfuck\nSince all invalid Brainfuck commands are removed, a cool trick was to include it at the start of the payload inside the SQL query. By putting it in the first column we don't have the \",\" that would break it.\n\nSSTI\nTwig and Jinja 2 start with the delimiter {{, so we need to find a payload that would work on both. I opted for the easy solution by checking if lipsum was defined.\n\nNow, we can add the Smarty payload by encapsulating the previous payload inside Smarty comment.\n\nFinally we can add the ERB SSTI, the Bash, and the Path Traversal payload after it.\n\nFinal Payload\n\nAfter the event I noticed it was possible to reduce the size of this payload by replacing null to 0, and removing spaces in the SSTI payloads.\n\nI also discovered too late that it was possible to merge the SQL injections and the XXE payloads :sad:.\n\nIt works because the ? is interpreted as NULL, and a bitshift with NULL is allowed and returns NULL.\n\nThis payload is great but it doesn't work anymore for the Brainfuck category. A simple fix is to add a \"&gt;\" at the start. Let's also reduce the size of the XXE by renaming the tags.\n\nConclusion\nNow that the event is over and the scoreboard shows the official solutions, I’m slightly ashamed to admit you could bypass the XPath challenge with a simple anything\"]|*?&gt;. Maybe o4-mini wasn't the right call to solve this part, next time I will use my brain 😅.\nHere are the last adjustments to complete the 13 challenges in one-shot:\n\nSwitch quote from &lt;%=ENV[\"FLAG\"]%&gt; to &lt;%=ENV['FLAG']%&gt;, to stay inside the double quote of the XPATH clause\nPut the Brainfuck payload inside Unicode double quote (＂) instead of the traditional (\")\nAdd the XPATH equivalent of \"OR 1=1\": \"]|*?&gt;\n\n\n\nBut in the end, this payload wouldn't reach the top 3 (Best score: 12606). Congratulation to the winners, your payloads were awesome ! 😍\nReferences\n\nYesWeHack Payload PLZ Challenge\nSQLite UNION\nPython vulnerabilities : Code execution in jinja templates - July 27, 2021.\n\n","id":"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/payload-plz/","title":"LeHack 2025 - PayloadPLZ"},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/ph0wn-ctf/":{"body":"Another week another CTF, this time it was the Ph0wn at Sophia Antipolis (France).

But somebody told me that there could be a hidden treasure in its main layout\n\nFirst we ran the new MobSF application and drag'n dropped the APK file into it : docker run -it --name mobsf -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest. After inspecting the source code we stumbled upon the following Java/Android at http://localhost:8000/ViewSource/?file=tux/android/biotmeteo/MainActivity.java&amp;md5=1b6d26562ca11c2d0c13fae063c93cd9&amp;type=apk indicating the flag was around.\n\nWe extracted the biotmeteo.apk as a zip file and started looking for the flag pattern ph0wn{ recursively.

Use the 3D_ant file as a model to mount the antenna. Collect your PCBs and use some tools and a soldering iron. Once your are ready, register on list to test if your prototype can receive the signal. 3 teams will make the test each 30mn.\nThe Master of the Chamber, Fabien, will guide you to the anechoic room.\n\nWe were given two PCB and an antenna, in order to get the flag we had to solder them the right way. To help us the organizers provided each team with this file : [Ph0wn-3D_ant.step]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/Ph0wn-3D_ant.step).\nIt's a step file containing a 3D vizualization of the final PCB.

What did he inject in those NFC sensors?!\n\n\nCome and get a sensor at the organizer desk (see the attached image to recognize the device you need to get)\nNota. Due to a server crash, if you see an IP address, modify with 35.241.137.50 (no DoS)\n\nSince the NFC is used by the sensor, let's check it with our proxmark3. With these data in mind we can find more informations about the sensor, it seems to be a FreeStyle Libre sensors.\n\nOn a StackOverflow post we find this goldmine :\n\nInstead, you will have to find out what commands the blood sugar meter actually supports (probably it will support the ISO/IEC 15693 READ SINGLE BLOCK command\n\nNow we know there is dump equivalent for NFC-V (ISO 15693), let's try it with the proxmark.\n\nSome data are cropped, we tried several applications on our Android device.

For that, he has bought a nice power meter, EcoCompteur from Legrand.\n\nConfiguration:\n\n\nIn Setup / Hardware, a Ph0wn EcoCompteur hardware is already partly configured for you (along with weather sensors), but you need to fix the IP address to: http://10.210.17.34:20000.\n\n\nUnfortunately, you may encounter a bug where you are unable to modify the existing hardware. In that case, delete it and create a new one. Also, the port 20000 must be specified in both the remote address and the port (other bug).\n\n\nThen, among Devices, you might like to tag \"Conso 1\" and \"Conso 2\": Conso 1 is the wine cellar, Conso 2 is the pool.\n\n\nA new docker instance is deployed for each team when they click on the challenge, this instance is binded to a random port of the server 10.210.17.34. Since there is no authentication to access the EcoCompteur we guessed we could access other contestants panel.\n\nWe downloaded the usage for both Conso 1 and Conso 2.\n\nWe can clearly identify some ASCII char, let's display them using Javascript.\n\nThe URL was a little buggy, we grabbed the flag at http://10.210.17.34:20000/n1ceflag\nFlag: ph0wn{h0w_about_using_a_candle_instead}\nCrypto - Shamir Quest\n\nPh0wn is so coooool.

This blog post is a quick writeup of a challenge from the Ph0wn CTF 2019 where you were given a small chip and you had to extract the flag from it.\n\n\nA long time ago I participated in the Ph0wn CTF and we had to solve a challenge called \"Flag Digger\".\nUnfortunately at the time I didn't have the tools and gadgets required to solve it.\nBut now in 2024 I recently got gifted an Hydrabus and I'm taking back my revenge 😈\nThe chip was clean and we can easily read the text on it. If you can't see it correctly, use your phone to take a picture and zoom on it or just buy a new pair of glasses 🤓. We get the following text: CSI 93C46P 0204H.\nA simple Google search helps us identifying the chip and its pinout: 93C46P datasheet\n\nFrom there we can deduce from the inscription \"DIP2Deep\", that we have to use the DIP Package.\nLet's connect our HydraBus to the chip, we can use the command show pin to know where to connect CLK, SDI and SDO. More commands and details about the connection can be found in this HydraFW 3wire guide.\n\n\nTo summarize we will connect the pins as follows:\n\nPin 3V3: +3V (HydraBus)  -&gt; Pin 8: Vcc (Chip)\nPin GND: GND (HydraBus) -&gt; Pin 5: GND (Chip)\nPin PB4: SDI (HydraBus) -&gt; Pin 4: DO (Chip)\nPin PB5: SDO (HydraBus) -&gt; Pin 3: DI (Chip)\nPin PB3: CLK (HydraBus) -&gt; Pin 2: SK (Chip)\nPin PC1: CS  (HydraBus) -&gt; Pin 1: CS (Chip)\n\n\nNow we want to interact with it, a simple READ instruction will do the trick. The datasheet gave us everything we needed to know about it, it has this format:\n\nIntruction: READ\nStart Bit: 1\nOpcode: 10\nAddress\n\n\nTo read the content starting from address 0x000000 we will send: 1 10 000000. Using the guide Bus interaction commands, we can craft a command to read a maximum of 255 bytes.\n\nNOTE: Changing the frequency with threewire1&gt; frequency 50k show, didn't impact the output result.\n\nThe output looks like ASCII characters, let's decode that in a Python interpreter.\n\nYep, that's a flag: ph0wn{M@st3r0f3wireMem0ry!}\nSince the writing of this blog post, bvernoux added the hd feature in the 3-wire mode, allowing us to directly parse the hex content into string.

They worked fine until my GameBoy battery died when I was saving the game. After rebooting the device, I discovered the save was corrupt and I lost 20+ hours...\nThen I opened my cartridges and discovered the internal battery was missing in this cheap reproduction. This means the game is using a batteryless save patch.\n\n\nA batteryless patch patches the ROM's save routine to dump the SRAM save to the ROM's flash chip, inside part of the ROM itself. It will also load back into SRAM when booted up. This means the game will temporarily freeze the system while it saves your game. But in the end, it saves you from ever needing to replace a battery in your cartridge, and you get peace of mind that your save won't ever just vanish someday from a dying battery.\n\nHere are a few key pointers about the battery in the GameBoy cartridge\n\nThe batteries inside a Game Boy Color cart are to save the game onto a chip and hold the memory while the console is powered off.\nYour Game Boy Color cartridge battery life is approximately 15-20 years depending on the quality of the battery.\n\nHowever if something happens during the temporary freeze, then your data is gone. Since I was bound to start from zero, I wondered if I could use some glitches to speed up a bit my adventure.\nIn this blog post I will dive into the inner workings of these glitches, and you will see that even as a 7 years old you were able to do some interesting memory manipulation and logic bug exploitation!\nSetup\nHere are the requirements to follow along the blog post and replicate the glitches.\n\nThe source code of Pokemon Yellow is available on GitHub, thanks to the pret team who reverse engineered 100% of the ROM: pret/pokeyellow\nROM file of Pokemon Yellow, any version (US/Europe/Japanese) will work, this blog post was done with d9290db87b1f0a23b89f99ee4469e34b\nEmulator with debugger: SameBoy 0.16.2\n\nSameboy support symbol files, you can build the ROM and then put breakpoints on specific functions using their name. Here is the symbol file for the original Pokemon Yellow rom : pokeyellow.sym\n\nThe following commands are a huge help when we want to debug our actions, pause the game or display the content of the memory at a specific address.\nCommandDescription\nregistersPrint values of processor registers and other important registers\nbacktraceDisplay the current call stack\nprintEvaluate and print an expression\nexamineExamine values at address\ndisassembleDisassemble instructions at address\nbreakpointAdd a new breakpoint at the specified address/expression or range\nwatchAdd a new watchpoint at the specified address/expression or range\nlistList all set breakpoints and watchpoints\nresetReset the program execution\ncontinueContinue running until next stop\ninterruptInterrupt the program execution\n\nPokemon Yellow\nIn the game you start with one Pokemon, a PIKACHU at level 2, given by Professor Oak. You also get some $$ from your mother, you should keep it safe because we will need 550$ to buy an Escape Rope for one of the glitches below.\nLong Range Trainer Glitch\nThe first glitch starts in the Viridian Forest, in order to reproduce it you have several requirements to met:\n\nBuy the Escape Rope (550 Poke$) at Pewter City mart.\nDo not battle the long-range trainer in the Viridian Forest.\n\nBut what is a long-range trainer ? In Pokemon there are two types of trainer, the one that engage a battle when you talk to them, or walk nearby, and the one that will walk toward you. The latter have an exclamation mark displayed on the screen when they see you.\n\nOnce they see you it will change 3 values in memory, to let the game know that a battle is started in this map.\n\nViridianForestCurScript = 1\nEngaged by Trainer = 1 ($CD60)\nNPC is moving = 1 ($D730)\n\n\nBut if you are fast enough, you can trigger an escape by using an item or an ability from the Start menu:\n\nEscape Rope (item)\nFly (ability)\nTeleport (ability)\n\n\nEvery time you move the game calls the OverworldLoopLessDelay which will check several actions in a specific actions:\n\ncheckIfStartIsPressed\ndisplayDialogue\ncheckForOpponent\n\nAs you can see, the game verify the start button before engaging the battle, allowing you to execute many actions from the menu.\n\n⚠️ When you use the Escape Rope, you will get teleported to the last Pokemon Center you visited. But you will be locked out of any interactions since the NPC is moving flag has been activated. Furthermore the start button will not work anymore because the game thinks you are in a battle: Engaged by Trainer = 1 ($CD60)\nDealing With the Side Effects\nThere is a way to clear the NPC is moving flag in Pewter City, a kid will walk you to the Gym when you try to go the East of the city. The value of the first bit at the address $D730 (NPC is moving) will be set back to 0 after the animation.\n\n\nDiving Into the Shared Memory\nNow we want to modify another value in memory located at $CD2D which correspond to the SPECIAL stat of the last Pokemon you encountered.\nAt this point in the game you can either go in the grass to find a wild pokemon, but we won't know its SPECIAL stat (unless you print the content of the address in your debugger ex $CD2D). Doing the glitch that way will be tedious, and will force us to restart the device every time the value is not the one we want... Or we can initiate a battle against a trainer, they have a fixed pokemon, meaning they always have the same stats.\nLet's do it with the first trainer in the GYM, he has a DIGGLET with a special stat of 14 (0x0e). This value will have a direct impact on the next pokemon we will encounter (spoiler alert: it will be a GENGAR).\n\nFor Pokemon Red and Blue, there is a map of trainers and the next pokemon you will get. Small warning, the map is huge, map by ryumaster. You will quickly realize that the pokemons are not ordered using the Pokedex ID, for example: RYDHON is the first one, so if you want a specific pokemon you will need the following list:\n\nList of Pokémon by index number in Generation I - Bulbagarden\nrbydigit.txt - ocf.berkeley.edu\n\nBut why is the SPECIAL stat impacting the ID of the next Pokemon ? It lies within the UNION and NEXTU keywords used in the ram/wram.asm file to define how the memory is structured.\n\nUNION is a directive that allows you to overlay multiple structures or data definitions in the same memory space.\nNEXTU is used to move to the next structure or field within the same union space\n\nIn short we have 3 structures that are using the same space in memory. This space has a size of 39 bytes.\n\nThe lower bytes of wEnemyMonUnmodifiedSpecial ($CD2C $CD2D) is located at the 31st bytes from the start of the structure, and it's also the case for wEngagedTrainerClass. It means they share the same address and content.\nwEngagedTrainerClass correspond to the type of Trainer that is battling you, for example: \"Youngster\", \"Bug Catcher\", \"Athlete\", \"Fisher\", etc. And the wEngagedTrainerSet is the number of the trainer.\n\nBut this is also used for wild Pokemon, the first variable is used to define the ID, and the second is the LEVEL.\nFor example, the following data is a GENGAR level 35.\n\nIf you want to calculate manually the spaces displayed on the GIF, here are a remainder of the units:\n\ndb (Define Byte): 1 byte (8bits)\ndw (Define Word): 2 bytes (16bits)\nds (Define Space): X bytes\n\nwMonEnemyAttackMod is another good thing we can see in these memory structures as it is mapped in the same area as the wEngagedTrainerSet. If we find a way to alter this data, we can arbitrarily set the level of the next pokemon we get.\nFortunately for us, there is another gadget we can use, it's the stat modifier. In Pokemon, every creature start with modifier set to 7 for the attack, speed, accuracy and other field.\nWhen some abilities are used, these modifiers will get their value either increased or decreased; with a respective cap of 13 and 1.\nIn short we can alter the level from a range of 1 to 13. It can be done using the Growl ability, which decrease the attack modifier of the enemy by one stage.\n\nRange from 7 to 1 for down modifier (ATK ⬇️, DEF ⬇️, SPEED ⬇️)\nRange from 7 to 13 for up modifier (ATK ⬆️, DEF ⬆️, SPEED ⬆️)\n\nHere is a quick example of downgrading the ATK modifier to 1 using the Growl ability several times .\n\nNow the memory should look like this, after battling a wild pokemon anywhere between Pewter Gym and the Viridian Forest.\n\nQuick note: The level can't go below 1 with this technique.\n\nStart Battle &amp; Weird Textbox\nNow it's time to trigger this battle with our GENGAR since we have tailored the memory to be the Pokemon #14 at the level 1. Going into the grass and getting attacked by wild Pokemon is not the correct way as it will update the fields EnemyMonUnmodifiedSpecial and MonEnemyAttackMod in the memory.\nActually it is way easier than that, when we escaped the battle using the «&nbsp;Escape Rope&nbsp;», we put the meta-map script ID into an inconsistent state. Meta-map scripts are also called GameProgressFlags, its a list of events used to execute code on the current map. For example, on the first map you can't walk into the grass until you advance further into the story, it is disabled later by changing the ID of the meta-map script.\nBy default the map of the Viridian Forest searches for trainers: CheckFightingMapTrainers (0), but we left it with DisplayEnemyTrainerTextAndStartBattle (1) when the «&nbsp;!&nbsp;» mark appeared before we \"escape\".\n\nBy going back to the map, the meta-map script will still be DisplayEnemyTrainerTextAndStartBattle, and it will launch a new battle with the parameter we carefully modified in the memory.\n\nThe textbox you get before the battle is the same ID as the last text box in memory, stored at the address $CF13.\nDepending on which choice you made to generate the next pokemon, it will have one of these values.\n\nID: 09: Talk to sign at the PokeCenter\nID: 02: GYM Trainer talk\nID: 05: NPC from Pewter City\n\n\nHere is another example, with the textbox: \"Hi, do you have a PIKACHU\"; corresponding to the ID 5 which means I only talked to the NPC from Pewter City and I didn't trigger the battle with the Trainer in the Gym.\n\nCapturing the Pokemon is left as an exercise for the reader. Even if it is a level 1, you will have to weaken him a lot, and I hope you have a lot of Pokeballs in your bag :P\nExperience Underflow\nNow we are done with memory manipulations, we have captured our GENGAR. Let's talk a bit about Experience Algorithms.\nIn Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow, there are 6 experience algorithms but only 4 are really used in the code: Medium Fast, Medium Slow, Fast and Slow.\n\nHere is a list of Pokemons belonging to the Medium Slow group: BULBASAUR\t, IVYSAUR, VENUSAUR, CHARMANDER, CHARMELEON, CHARIZARD, SQUIRTLE, WARTORTLE, BLASTOISE, PIDGEY, PIDGEOTTO, PIDGEOT, NIDORAN♀, NIDORINA, NIDOKING, NIDORAN♂, NIDORINO, NIDOQUEEN, ODDISH, GLOOM, VILEPLUME, POLIWAG, POLIWHIRL, POLIWRATH, ABRA\t, KADABRA\t, ALAKAZAM, MACHOP, MACHOKE, MACHAMP, BELLSPROUT, WEEPINBELL, VICTREEBEL, GEODUDE, GRAVLER, GOLEM, GASTLY, HAUNTER, GENGAR, MEW.\nDo you see the problem with the Polynomial Function used for this group ?\nYes, the value is negative for the levels 0 and 1. This is an absolute horror since it will be stored inside an unsigned integer. This type of data doesn't care about the sign, so -54 XP will become 16 777 162 XP.\nDespite the experience being for an extremely high level, you only need 1 059 860 XP to get to level 100 for Pokemon in the Medium Slow group, and you can't go higher than 100.\n\n\nIn short, if your level 1 Pokemon gains less than 54 XP, its current level will be computed from its previous XP. Do you recall how much it was ? Our pokemon had over 16 777 162 XP, getting level 100 in one battle !\n\n\nPro tip: Don't fight with your level 1 Pokemon, it is mostly likely not strong enough (unless its a METAPOD, they don't do damage).\nBONUS 1 - MEW\nThese glitches can be used later in the game to get the event exclusive MEW. It's basically using the Long Range Trainer glitch to escape the fight on the Route 24, then you engage in a battle with the Kid Route 25 to have the Slowpoke stats in memory.\n\nBONUS 2 - Prof Oak\nEarlier in this blog, we discovered that Trainer and Pokemon are the same thing.\n\nSpecial stat &lt; 200 triggers a Pokemon battle\nSpecial stat &gt;= 200 triggers a Trainer battle\n\nHowever you won't find many Pokemon with a special stat over 200. But there is a way to remediate to this problem. The Pokemon DITTO have the Transform ability which will copy itself into your Pokemon, it will also copy the stats.\nDid you know that Prof Oak is not available in the game story, but he is coded and can be battled using a combination of the previous glitches. His index number is 226, which is also the default value of MEWTWO SPECIAL stat.\nThis glitch requires 2 long range trainer because you won’t have the NPC from Pewter City to reset the «&nbsp;NPC is moving&nbsp;» value. Also you need a Pokemon with Growl to set one of the 3 teams attributed to him.\nHere are the steps to battle him:\n\nFly to Lavender City, go to Route 8, trigger the Long Range Trainer\nFly to Cerualean City, go to Route 24, trigger the second Long Range Trainer, but you have to defeat him, to reset the «&nbsp;NPC is moving&nbsp;» value\nFly to Cinnabar Island, and go to the Pokemon Mansion and find a DITTO (you have to go to a specific room)\nWait for DITTO to copy your Pokemon with SPECIAL at 226\nThen switch to a Pokemon knowing Growl, use it 4 times (BLASTOISE), 5 times (VENUSAUR), 6 times (CHARIZARD)\nThen run away from the battle, use an Escape Rope, then fly back Lavender City, go to Route 8 to trigger the battle with Prof Oak.\n\n\n\nI hope you liked these glitches, here are some saves to have every requirements met in order to reproduce them. Some saves are from a finished run where the long trainers have been re-enabled, use them to get Mew or fight Prof Oak.\n\nPokemon - Yellow Version (UE) [C][!] - LongRangeTrainerForest.sav\nPokemon - Yellow Version (UE) [C][!] - XPGlitchGengar.sav\nPokemon - Yellow Version (UE) [C][!] - XPGlitchNidoking.sav\nPokemon - Yellow Version (UE) [C][!] - AfterDigglet_EncounteringGengar.sav\nPokemon - Yellow Version (UE) [C][!] - FinishedGame_LongRangeTrainersPatched.sav\nPokemon - Yellow Version (UE) [C][!] - ProfOakReady.sav\nPokemon - Yellow Version (UE) [C][!] - MewGlitch_TrainerEnabled.sav\nPokemon - Yellow Version (UE) [C][!] - Gengar LVL100 + 50 Rare Candy.sav\n\nReferences\n\nCPU registers and flags - gbdev.io\nR/B/Y Stat Modification - The Cave of Dragonflies - March 29 2018\nList of glitches in Generation I - Bulbagarden\nYellow Glitches - Level 100 Before Brock - cerealz - March 10 2014\nLevel 100 Nidoking Glitch Pokemon Yellow - Pokemon Glitches and More - February 14 2014\nHow to capture a wild Gengar in Pokemon Yellow - hXcHector - 28 july 2018\nThe Most EXPLOITABLE GLITCH in Pokémon - Trainer-Fly (Mew Glitch) - Azure Flute -  8 dec 2023\nBattle Professor Oak - Gamefaqs - zerokid - 03/21/2023\nHow to Catch MEW in Pokemon Yellow without Cheating!

In this \"small\" blog post I will write about this experience, the challenges and our methodology :)\n![Banner]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterBanner.png \"Banner\"){: .center-image }\n\nRules &amp; informations about the CTF are available in the following PDF : [CTF_UYBHYS.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/CTF_UYBHYS.pdf)\nCTF Architecture\nAll teams had the same virtual machines to secure and attack.\n\nbastion.unlock.ctf : 172.16.1.20\nwww.unlock.ctf : 172.16.1.10\nplc.unlock.ctf : 192.168.12.10\nwin.unlock.ctf : 192.168.0.10\nfw.unlock.ctf (PfSense)\n\nThese machines host some services such as Web Servers, RDP etc... We had access to the source code of the binaries and the URL alive.unlock.ctf displayed the status of all teams services. In the following picture you can clearly see Team08 and Team10 didn't patch their RDP.\n![Alive]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterAlive.png \"Alive services\"){: .center-image }\nIn the first 30 minutes we could access our machines and secure them without losing any points, then the scoreboard will update every 20 seconds to decrease your point if a service is down, you also loose point when a team is stealing one of your flag. Based on what we had we mapped the services linked to a flag and 2 columns to check if they were patched and/or exploited.\n\nIt was possible to trade some points for hints and insights in the Black Market, however nothing is guaranted: flags and hints might be wrong or misleading. We took the $0 trade, this gave us a list of the teams and their corresponding sea monster :\n\nwin.unlock.ctf\nI wasn't paying attention when the organizers told us the account was not user as stated in the PDF but in fact Administrator. Missing this information, made me try to exploit the machine in order to get an NT AUTORITY SYSTEM shell, I went to the easy path Eternal Blue.\n![Windows Eternal Blue]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterWin.png \"Windows Eternal Blue\"){: .center-image }\nRDP - 3389\nHowever the SMB service was not forwarded by the firewall and we couldn't exploit the service, it seems the intended way was to use Bluekeep as the RDP was checked by the bot and the team lose some points until we opened a Port Forward rule.\n![Firewall]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterFirewall.png \"Firewall services\"){: .center-image }\nplc.unlock.ctf\nModbus - 502\nThis machine was an easy win, we used plcscan to scan the Modbus service on port 502, the PLC description contained the flag.\n![Modbus]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterModbusScan.png \"Modbus services\"){: .center-image }\n![PLC]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterPLC.png \"PLC description\"){: .center-image }\n\nbastion.unlock.ctf\nSSRF - Port 8080\nThe web server on port 8080 allows the user to ping a machine, we runned the grep binary on the entire disk to find files containing flags and used the SSRF to display them with http://team14.ctf:8080/index.php?ip=file://PATH_TO_FILE.\nIt appears we could read the file file:///etc/bind/zones/unlock.ctf.db, so we scripted the exploitation of this challenge, however this was the flag for the Port 53...\n\n![Bind]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterWWWssrfpath.png \"Bind\"){: .center-image }\nWe made the mistake to assume a simple filter like $ip[0] == \"1\" would be enough to stop any exploitation on our machine, however we missed the critical point. Another service was available on port 6666, which would display the content of the file using a specificly crafted URL. We saw the exploit in our logs and replayed the URL on the other team to get more flags.\nwww.unlock.ctf\nNostromo - Port 3232\nWe used the CVE-2019-16278 to exploit the Nostromo service on the web machine.\n\nOur patch might have been the worst of all patch history, we made a copy a the current index page with curl and then replaced the nostromo service with a python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3232. Dirty but efficient !\n![Trade]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterTrade.jpg \"Trade\"){: .center-image }\nCustom website - Port 80\nFirst part of the exploitation was to create an account to access the website and find the SQL injection. The exploitation doesn't need to be logged in, the flag was stored as a plaintext password for the administrator. SQLmap and simple for loop were enough to exploit the vulnerability and dump the users table.\n![SQL]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterSQL.png \"SQL\"){: .center-image }\nThe website contains multiple vulnerabilities, once logged as admin we can access the upload page, even though the HTML upload part was commented.\n![UPLOAD]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterWWWuploadcode.png \"upload\"){: .center-image }\nThe PHP backend is doing some checks but it is not enough to prevent the upload of a PHP file in the images directory, we used a payload from PayloadsAllTheThings and then executed our commands with http://team12.ctf/images_import/PHP_exif_system.php?c=whoami. Unfortunately the CTF ended when we got our command exec... (otherwise we might have been able to exploit EternalBlue against the Windows machine and grab the flag located in C:\\flag).\nEven if you had patched these vulnerabilities in the website, there were two backup folders site.bak and site_save to remove.\n![Backup]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SeaMonster/SeaMonsterWWWtree.png \"Backup\"){: .center-image }\nFinal Thought\nThe CTF was great, the infrastructure worked flawlessly and the challenge difficulty was balanced enough to let the team understand, patch and exploit them during the 5 hours timeframe. We finished 1st but I would like to thank all the teams for their fair-play and the organisers for the event.

I was wrong but it was nonetheless interesting to solve.\n\nThe source code of the index was available by requesting : http://finale-docker.rtfm.re:4444/?source\n\nAt first I tried to access the database with my browser by requesting finale-docker.rtfm.re:4444/mdauth.db, unfortunately that didn't work. Let's dig deeper into the source code. We want to authenticate on the Web Application, maybe we can do an SQL injection inside the following query.\n\nIn order to exploit this, we need to bypass the escapeString function used for $login and $hash.\n\nThe md5 function is called with the second argument set to true, meaning we will get a binary output instead of a hexadecimal one. We might be able to get a backslash in the binary output, but we need to know the APP_SALT value in order to do our offline bruteforce. The author of the challenge was kind enough to provide a way to get this secret by misusing the cookie.\n\nWe can do a single failed attempt in order to get a cookie containing the md5(SALT+\"1\"), based on the comment in the code we know the SALT is between 0000000-9999999 (7-digit APP_SALT).\nI got MD5:4322dfb1e9b20645594e9f3f6998845a which correspond to the following PLAIN:86203711. We now have our APP_SALT value : 8620371. The following script will bruteforce the first 1000 numbers looking for a quote in the last char of the MD5 output.\n\nIn my first attempt, I was looking for a backslash \"\" in order to escape the single quote \"'\" from the query and use the login to complete the SQL injection.\n\nIt would have worked in a MySQL database, unfortunately we were in front of a SQLite one. The documentation and stackoverflow provided the useful information, escaping is done by doubling the quote.\n\nI adjusted the script to check for a single quote and got the number 45.\n\nNow it's just a simple SQL injection, by using the following credential i was able to extract interesting data.\n\nI got the following users : admin and flaggy.

Then I implemented a new module called axfr to trigger a DNS zone transfer from the SSRF using the gopher protocol. This blog post is about my journey on implementing it.\n\n\nBefore going further, we need to define what is a DNS zone transfer. Let's ask ChatGPT for a quick description of this interesting DNS feature.\n\nA DNS zone transfer is a process used to replicate the DNS records from the master DNS server to secondary DNS servers. This ensures that all the DNS servers in a domain have the same information, which is crucial for redundancy and load balancing. Zone transfers are typically initiated by the secondary server, requesting a copy of the DNS zone file from the primary server. They can be done in two main ways: full zone transfer (AXFR) and incremental zone transfer (IXFR).\n\nSSRFmap is a tool I started 6 years ago, I'm proud to release the v2 now, with new modules, improvements for the Docker container, and new SSRF scenarios in the tests cases. Also issues have been fixed and dependencies upgraded. It should be a breeze to use it for your SSRF exploitation scenario, either in CTF and real world targets.\nSSRF Lab\nNow let's create a lab with a basic SSRF vulnerability and a DNS service. For the SSRF we will use the examples of SSRFmap: SSRFmap/examples/example.py, which is just a Flask app with the endpoint ssrf that will spawn a curl command with the provided URL.\n⚠️ This code is vulnerable to SSRF but also to Remote Command Execution. Be careful when you run it, and restrict your network interactions.\n\nWe also need the file SSRFmap/examples/ssrf_dns.py from the examples folder. Then we start both, either on your machine with python examples/example.py and python examples/ssrf_dns.py or with the docker commands to have every requirements correctly installed:\n\nNow you should be able to interact with the ssrf service using a curl command: curl -i -X POST -d 'url=http://example.com' http://localhost:5000/ssrf, and it will fetch the content of the example.com website.\nThe best way to debug when you are sending queries over the network is to run wireshark in the background. This way you can inspect the request, save the payload and even replay it later.\nAXFR Query\nLet's start with a simple AXFR query directly to the DNS server: dig @127.0.0.1 -p 53 example.lab AXFR\nIn this example:\n\n@127.0.0.1: specify the DNS server to query\n53 is the port number to connect to on the DNS server\nexample.lab is the domain name for which the DNS records are being queried\nAXFR, the type of DNS query to execute\n\nOur wireshark capture contains the AXFR query.\n\nLet's inspect the query in details using the wireshark dissector:\n\nThis DNS query can be extracted as hex with Copy as hex stream in Wireshark: 0034a9c100200001000000000001076578616d706c65036c61620000fc000100002904d000000000000c000a0008180f72afca818649\n\nThe AXFR request format is as follow.\nHeader\nDataDescription\nXXLength\nXXXXTwo-byte query ID selected by the client\n0020Standard query\n00Recursion not available, no Z bits, RCODE 0\n0001Exactly one question\n0000Answer records\n0000Authority records\n0001Additional records\n\nQuery\nDataDescription\n07Length domain part 1: 7\n6578616d706c65Domain part 1: example\n03Length domain part 2: 3\n6c616Domain part 2: lab\n00fcAXFR query: 252\n0001Internet query class\n\nAdditional Record\nThis part is not essential for our exploit, but I included it in this blog post for the sake of completeness.\nDataDescription\n00Name\n0029Type OPT\n04d00UDP payload\n00Something?\n00EDNSO version\n0000Z\n00c0Data length\n00a0008180f72afca818649Option COOKIE\n\nWe will replay this query using netcat on port 53 (TCP). This works because the DNS server from ssrf_dns.py is listening on both UDP and TCP.\n\nBut we can shorten this payload by removing the Additional records, change 01 to 00 in the correct part of the header.\nDon't forget to change the length in the header section.\n\n\nFinally, the server answers with 4 subdomains on example.lab.\n\nGopher Protocol\nNow the next step is to transform this request to be able to send it through an SSRF. For this, we will use the gopher protocol.\n\nThe Gopher protocol (/ˈɡoʊfər/) is a communication protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents in Internet Protocol networks. - Wikipedia\n\nIt is very easy to use this protocol with the gopher scheme: gopher://IP:PORT/_DATA.\nIn theory, the payload should be as follow: gopher://127.0.0.1:53/_%00%1d%a9%c1%00%20%00%01%00%00%00%00%00%00%07%65%78%61%6d%70%6c%65%03%6c%61%62%00%00%fc%00%01. The final exploit requires an URL encoding.\n\nBug Fix in libcurl\nHowever, in my first attempt it didn't work because the gopher protocol is not accepting a NULL BYTE (%00). I went into the issues of the curl project and I discovered this one : issues/9089\n\nYes, using libcurl/7.47.0.

This was achieved using a Xiaomi Android Application, we recorded everything broadcasted on the frequency in this file:\n\n[Recording FM @ 101.1 MHz]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/FM_101.1 MHz_20220520212911.mp3)\n\nWe can hear the well known military code, which gave us this .onion website:\nhttp://sthackmdbidwkyebhklnfnwmqhj3oxnke5inylzrtwzenr752tn77oad.onion:80, we accessed it using Tor.\nAfter some time exploring the website we discovered \"a feature\" to send a mail with an extract of the current code when an error occured on the website.\nWe found two ways to trigger an error:\n\ntrying to login using a wrong password: LoginController.php\nwhile injecting and breaking context inside the shop part of the website: Lexer.php\n\nThe team spent too much time trying to find a Server Side Template Injection since it was using a twig template in line 21@LoginController.php.\n![Dump code controller]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_dump_code_controller.png)\n![Dump code lexer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_dump_code_lexer.png)\nHowever while we were fuzzing the category field, we discovered the '~' was working to concatenate two strings in Twig and tried the following requests:\nQueryOutputIndicator\ncategory=category == 'forgery'Displays the product \"Coated Something\"True\ncategory=category == 'forg'~'ery'Displays the product \"Coated Something\"True\ncategory=category == 'forg''ery''7'*7Don't display but do not throw an errorFalse\n\nWe had an oracle !! However we didn't manage to find an interesting primitive allowing us to execute commands.\nSo we used our favorite tool \"Burp Suite Intruder\" and fuzzed with the top 100 functions in PHP and Symfony and some weird behaviors started to appear.\nThe function constant was recognised by the parsing engine, then it clicked, the Lexer.php file was located in a folder called expression language. We tried to confirm the function using several global constants.\n\nHowever it's only giving us the information about the existence of a constant it would be better to extract their value. Especially the value of the constant self::PASSWORD@LoginController.php.\nFirst, we attempt to access the constant located in another file on the server. Thankfully the server errors were quite verbose and give us half of the payload :)\n\nThe trick here was to add several backslash \\\\\\\\\n\nNow that we confirmed the access to the PASSWORD constant, we tried to read the characters one-by-one like any array with array[0] == 'A'. But the pain was only starting, Expression Language constant cannot be accessed like an array... We finally found an alternative using Regular Expressions and created a small script which was ... too slow, remember we are using Tor to connect to the .onion website and the shared network on site was a bit laggy.\n\nOnce again we turned to our Intruder and fuzzed with the charset a-zA-Z0-9, with the following payload: category=constant(\"\\\\App\\\\Controller\\\\LoginController::PASSWORD\") matches \"/^Y[FUZZED_CHAR_ADDED_HERE]/\" &amp;&amp; category == 'forgery' and we got the following quite quickly: Ybhr5vmjJD after switching to our 4G network for a more reliable access.\nNow we can access the Admin Panel and manage the products. Only one product (deaddrop) as available for purchase.\n![Web Login]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_deaddrop-login.png)\n\nDead Drops is an anonymous, offline, peer to peer file-sharing network in public space. Anyone can access a Dead Drop and everyone may install a Dead Drop in their neighborhood/city. A Dead Drop must be public accessible. - The Dead Drops Manifesto\n\nThe product coordinates were really close to us and the challenge was listed in the categories web and physical. We went there with a laptop and other tools like a lockpick set. Obviously the deaddrop wasn't embbeded into the \"Hotel de Ville\"'s wall, it was cemented to a pad lock ;)\n![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_gpslocate.png)\nSome interesting encrypted files were stored on the deaddrop and we had the key to decrypt them using the command openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in whisky.txt.aes256cbc -out secrets2.txt.new\n![AES secrets]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_aes_key.png)\nAnd now for the final step: a new onion URL from one of the decrypted file (maltapyzyfnwvgkl4se7tlhlrohule77cgnaguy2nouxyvosovjldbyd.onion). It seems to be an aunction website, but the site is not yet opened. The opening is scheduled for the 23rd May but something smells fishy, the Javascript was heavily obfuscated, and we are still waiting for our flag.\n\nLet's discuss methodology to apprehend this problem:\n![JS deobf]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_deobf.jpg)\nHaving spent wayyyy too much time on this challenge, we used a quite radical approach and changed our VM internal date slowly to arrived at the opening date: date -s \"2021-03-23 16:58:22\" and then we got our flag.\nOverall the challenge was nice and interesting to resolve with my teammates. Having a bit of physical without resorting to use a full arsenal of HackRF, Proxmark or a crowbar was quite refreshing :)\n![Scoreboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/STHACK2022/sthack2022_scoreboard.jpg)\n","id":"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/sthack2022/","title":"STHACK2022 - Catch the bird, a trip from web to IRL"},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/whidinjector/":{"body":"What is it ? The WHID Injector is USB Key which act as a remote keyboard. Basically it sets up a Wifi Access Point where you can connect and send whatever you want on the machine. It also has a Rubber Ducky payload converter, an exfiltrated data tab and many more.\nWhat can I do ? Everything you could do with a keyboard plugged into a computer, for example : using WHID Toolkit you can spawn a reverse-shell :D\nWhere to buy a WHID Injector ? I got mine from Aliexpress, it's also available on ebay around 15+ $ ;)\nBasic Setup\nFirst you need to connect the web server hosted on \"http://192.168.1.1\", only reachable over the Exploit Wifi. Use the following default credentials to connect to the AP.\n\nWhen you want to update/upgrade some components you will have to login with these credentials.\nThe default administration\n\nBuild your own firmware (do not trust the fishy chinese firmware from internet :P)\nSetup Arduino IDE\nOne who buys an electronic usb stick online might want to change the firmware in order to get rid of a backdoor, or just to upgrade it.\n\nDownload and Install the Arduino IDE from http://www.arduino.cc\nGo to File - Preferences. Locate the field \"Additional Board Manager URLs:\"\nAdd http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json or https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/releases/download/2.3.0/package_esp8266com_index.json if an error occured.\nSelect Tools - Board - Boards Manager. Search for \"esp8266\".\nInstall \"esp8266 by ESP8266 community version 2.3.0\".\n\nIf it's not enough I saw someone installing the following ;)\n\nCustomized keyboard mapping\nIf you are french you might want a french keyboard with AZERTY mapping, unfortunately this isn't the default behavior of the WHiD Injector. Now we will modify the file Keyboard.cpp to replace the english charset with a french one.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/exploitagency/ESPloitV2.git\nGo back inside the arduino folder and open arduino-1.8.4/libraries/Keyboard/src/Keyboard.cpp\nReplace the _asciimap with this one\n\n\nUpdate Arduino Component\nLet's build the Arduino project, open the Arduino_32u4_code in the folder ESPloitV2.\nIn the IDE choose these options:\n\nSelect Tools - Board : LilyPad Arduino USB.\nSelect Tools - Port : /dev/ttyACM0\nBuild and upload the sketch (you might need superprivilege)\n\nUpdate ESPloitV2\nCreating a custom firmware is the only way to modify the UI, to do so you will need to open the ESP_Code sketch:\n\nOpen the ESP_Code sketch from the source folder.\nSelect Tools - Board - \"Generic ESP8266 Module\". (Previously installed)\nSelect Tools - Flash Size - \"4M (3M SPIFFS)\". (You need this, otherwise the IDE will throw an error about size)\nSelect Sketch - \"Export Compiled Binary\".\n\nThe firmware is now available in your /tmp/arduino_build_XXXXXX/*.bin. The upgrade firmware function in the panel at 192.168.1.1 will upload the file.bin and reboot the WHiD Injector.\nHoly sh*t, I bricked my device\nChill my friend, this device is hard to brick. If you have messed really hard you can push the reset button.\n\nOpen Arduino IDE and open ESP Programmer sketch\nInsert WHID\nPress Upload sketch and start the unbrick phase in the same time\n\n\nStart the unbrick phase with a magnet by placing it close that side of the PCB where the hall sensor is located (do it two times). Close-away-close-away\n\nPlay time\nHere is a simple payload which will spawn a terminal in a remote computer, you can either run it inside the livepayload tab of the AP, or you can use the Whid Toolkit\n\nDocs:\n\nhttps://camo.githubusercontent.com/11652f5ea3a5600654e558177a5311893392ee73/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7041636c55544d2e6a7067\nhttp://www.zem.fr/utiliser-mouse-keyboard-azerty-arduino-pro-micro-teensy/\n\n","id":"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/whidinjector/","title":"WHID Injector - Tips and Tricks"},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/pages/","title":""},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/posts/":{"body":"\n30 Jun 2025 // LeHack 2025 - PayloadPLZ\n02 Oct 2024 // Anatomy of Pokemon glitches\n13 Jun 2024 // SSRFmap - Introducing the AXFR module\n04 Feb 2024 // Ph0wn CTF 2019 - Flag Digger\n15 Jan 2024 // DLS 2024 - RedTeam Fails - \"Oops my bad I ruined the operation\"\n30 Sep 2022 // Offensive Nim - Auto Obfuscate Strings with Nim's Term-Rewriting Macros\n21 May 2022 // STHACK2022 - Catch the bird, a trip from web to IRL\n26 Apr 2020 // FCSC - CTF Writeup\n26 Dec 2019 // DVID - Damn Vulnerable IoT Device\n14 Dec 2019 // Ph0wn CTF 2019 - Smart Devices CTF\n26 Nov 2019 // UYBHYS - Sea Monster Attack &amp; Defense CTF\n22 Jun 2019 // HIP19 Writeup - Meet Your Doctor 1,2,3\n23 Dec 2018 // SIGSEGV1 Writeup - MD Auth\n14 Aug 2018 // An XSS Story\n18 Jan 2018 // WHID Injector - Tips and Tricks\n08 Nov 2017 // French Croissant - or why you need to lock your computer\n07 Nov 2017 // ECW CTF - Web Writeups\n\n","id":"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/posts/","title":"📝 Posts"},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/projects/":{"body":"\n\n📖 PayloadsAllTheThings - A list of useful payloads and bypass for Web Application Security and Pentest/CTF\n\n\n\n🖥️ HardwareAllTheThings - Hardware/IOT Pentesting Wiki\n\n\n📕 InternalAllTheThings - Active Directory and Internal Pentest Cheatsheets\n\n\nOther Projects\n\nSSRFmap - Automatic SSRF fuzzer and exploitation tool\nGraphQLmap - A scripting engine to interact with a GraphQL endpoint for pentesting purposes.\nSharpLAPS - Retrieve LAPS password from LDAP\nWordpresscan - Wordpress scanner\nWHID_Toolkit - Simple script for the WHID injector - a rubberducky wifi\nDamn Web Scanner - Extension for Chrome/Opera\n\n","id":"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/projects/","title":"✨ Projects"}},"docInfo":{"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/about/":{"body":5,"title":0},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/an-xss-story/":{"body":122,"title":2},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/auto-obfuscate-strings-with-nim/":{"body":340,"title":9},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/drink-love-share-rump/":{"body":819,"title":8},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/dvid/":{"body":397,"title":5},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/ecw-ctf/":{"body":405,"title":4},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/fcsc/":{"body":532,"title":3},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/frenchcroissant/":{"body":330,"title":5},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/hip19-meetyourdoctor/":{"body":396,"title":5},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/payload-plz/":{"body":720,"title":3},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/ph0wn-ctf/":{"body":527,"title":6},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/ph0wn-flag-digger/":{"body":267,"title":5},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/pokemon-glitches/":{"body":1521,"title":3},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/seamonsterctf/":{"body":502,"title":6},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/sigsegv-md-auth/":{"body":186,"title":4},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/ssrfmap-axfr/":{"body":529,"title":4},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/sthack2022/":{"body":462,"title":6},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/blog/whidinjector/":{"body":337,"title":4},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/posts/":{"body":133,"title":1},"https://swisskyrepo.github.io/projects/":{"body":54,"title":1}},"length":23},"lang":"English"}
